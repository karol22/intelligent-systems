In this problem, you will write a program that analyzes the characteristics of various states in Mexico. For this exercise, create text files with the following data:

Which states are adjacent to each other.
States with high crime rates.
States with severe drought.
States where smart people live.
States with large populations that prefer to drink brandy instead of beer.
Agricultural states.
Industrialized states.
Write a program in Python that loads the text files that you created for this exercise. Then, using logic programming, answer the following questions:

What states have high crime rates and have a severe drought?
What states are adjacent to the states with people that prefer to drink brandy?
What states are industrialized and are good places for smart people?
What states are adjacent to the agricultural states or adjacent to industrialized states?
What states are adjacent to both Estado de México and Ciudad de México?
What agricultural states have severe drought and high crime rates?
What states are adjacent to a state with high crime rates?
What states have smart people or have large populations that prefer to drink brandy?
