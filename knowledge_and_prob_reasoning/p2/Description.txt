Implement in python the following Bayesian network. This network models the marks (m) of a student on his examination for admission into a university.
The variables of this model represent the following:

Exam level (e): This is a discrete variable that can take two values, (difficult, easy).
IQ of the student (i): A discrete variable that can take two values (low, high).
Aptitude score (s): A discrete variable that can take two values (low, high).
Mark (m): A discrete variable that can take two values (low, high).
Admission to the university (a): A discrete variable that can take two values (accepted, rejected).
Print all the joint probabilities of this model.

If you answer the following questions, you will get 20 extra points in this homework:

What is the probability of having a high IQ given that you were accepted into the university?
What is the probability of being accepted?
What is the probability of being accepted if you have a low aptitude score?
